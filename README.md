Python Projects: Hacker Simulation Game & Smart Budget Tracker

1. Hacker Simulation Game

Overview
The **Hacker Simulation Game** allows the player to act as a hacker trying to breach a secure system by guessing a 4-digit code. Each failed attempt increases the system's suspicion level, and too many failures lock the user out.

How to Play
1. Run the script and enter your hacker alias.
2. Choose an action:
   - 1. Attempt to Hack
   - 2. Check Suspicion Level
   - 3. Exit Game
3. Guess the correct code to reset suspicion. If suspicion reaches the maximum limit, you get locked out.

Keywords Used
- `class`, `def`, `return`, `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `try`, `except`, `import`, `break`, `continue`, `global`, `in`, `is`, `not`
